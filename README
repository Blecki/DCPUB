DCPUC, A C-like language for the DCPU-16, the 16-bit 'hardware' in Mojang's game 0x10c. 

This compiler targets DCPU assembly. http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt
Updated for the new spec at http://dcpu.com/highnerd/dcpu16.txt
Updated for http://dcpu.com/highnerd/dcpu16_1_3.txt (And for something I overlooked in the previous one)

NOTE THAT THIS LANGUAGE MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO SUPPORT HARDWARE FEATURES LIKE INTERRUPTS OR HARDWARE DEVICES. But, it DOES provide inline assembly.
Nor does it emit any instructions that use the EX register. A library implementing larger sized types wouldn't have any trouble using it, though.

I know of no emulators that support the new spec. 

//The output of this compiler has been tested with this emulator https://github.com/mappum/DCPU-16 and may output the 'BRK' instruction, which is a feature of that emulator and not of the official DCPU-16 spec.

There is a simple GUI compiler included (DCPUCIDE). Try compiling this program:

function fib(n:unsigned):unsigned
{
   if (n < 2u) return n;
   return fib(n-1u) + fib(n-2u);
}

var a:unsigned = fib(6u);

Have fun, and read the language spec!
