DCPUC, A C-like language for the DCPU-16, the 16-bit 'hardware' in Mojang's game 0x10c. 
This compiler targets DCPU assembly. http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Q4JvQvnM

DCPUC quick start -
Download 'DCPUC release.zip' from the repository. Within you will find pre-built versions of the preprocessor (bin/pre.exe) and the compiler (bin/b.exe).
Preprocess the helloworld sample with "pre helloworld.dc helloworld.pdc".
Compile with "b -in "helloworld.pdc" -out "helloworld.dasm"".
The compiler can produce binary output with the -binary flag. It defaults to little-endian, but will produce big-endian output with the -be flag.
