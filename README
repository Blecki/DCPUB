DCPUC, A C-like language for the DCPU-16, the 16-bit 'hardware' in Mojang's game 0x10c. 

This compiler targets DCPU assembly. http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Q4JvQvnM

NOTE THAT THIS LANGUAGE MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO SUPPORT HARDWARE FEATURES LIKE INTERRUPTS OR HARDWARE DEVICES. But, it DOES provide inline assembly.
Nor does it emit any instructions that use the EX register. A library implementing larger sized types wouldn't have any trouble using it, though.

I know of no emulators that support the new spec. 

There is a simple GUI compiler included (DCPUCIDE). Try compiling this program:

function fib(n) 
{
	if (2 > n) return n;
	return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}

var a = fib(6);

Compiles too...

; var a = fib(6);
      SET A, 0x0006
      JSR L1fib
      SET PUSH, A
   :L0main_footer
   SUB PC, 0x0001
;DCPUC FUNCTION fib L1fib 1
; function fib(n)
      :L1fib
; if (2 > n)
            IFA 0x0002, A
; return n;
               SET PC, POP
; return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
            SET PUSH, A
            SUB A, 0x0001
            JSR L1fib
            SET PUSH, A
            SET A, [0x0001+SP]
            SUB A, 0x0002
            JSR L1fib
            ADD A, POP
            ADD SP, 0x0001
            SET PC, POP
      :L2fib_footer
      SET PC, POP
;END FUNCTION

Have fun, and read the language spec!
