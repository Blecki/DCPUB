[ ] Sample Programs
[ ] - Struct sample
[ ] Comparison Operators
[*] Struct syntax sugar
[ ] operator[]
[ ] Compile options
[*] Compound assignment operators
[*] Command line interface
[*] Multiple pass compilation
[*]	- Pass 1: Build symbol tree. 
[*]	- Pass 2: Resolve symbols.
[*]	- Pass 3: Fold constants and prune.
[*]	- Pass 3b: Assign registers
[*]	- Pass 4: Emit assembly
[ ] Support multiple calling conventions
[*] Implement callee register protection
[*] Function header/footer rather than multiple return points
[ ] Don't transform strings to bytes
[ ] 'length of' operator, applies to datalists and stack-allocated arrays (resolves at compile time)
[ ] Don't halt on errors (May not be possible with parser errors)
[ ] Move all DAT emission to top of program so locations can be predicted and folded
[ ] Implement http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sethi%E2%80%93Ullman_algorithm
[ ] BUG: Variables leak out of IF/WHILE blocks when condition is constant UPDATE: Apparently I neglected to implement branch block scopes at all.
[ ] BUG: stack allocated array produce extraneous DAT
[ ] Preprocessor (Perhaps the constant folding pass can expand defines?)
[*] signed/unsigned types
[*] function return types
[*] type checking for function parameters and returned values
[ ] BUG: parameters pushed in wrong order
[*] Do not emit errors and warnings directly into assembly stream
[ ] Pushing stack parameters before ABC parameters may allow stack parameters to use more registers (Or at least access ABC parameters more efficiently)
[ ] BUG: Divide by 0 in folded constants crashes compiler
[ ] Default type should (probably) be signed [Though many operations result in unsigned types.]
[ ] Don't emit warnings for folded constant conversions that don't lose data.
[*] 'sizeof' operator
[ ] Freestore/heap implementation
[ ] Document structs
[*] Allow any constant expression in array declarations
[ ] Ternary ?: operator
[ ] pre/post inc/dec operators
