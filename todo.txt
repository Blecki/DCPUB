[ ] Sample Programs
[ ] - Struct sample
[ ] Comparison Operators
[ ] Compile options
[ ] Support multiple calling conventions
[ ] Don't transform strings to bytes
[ ] 'length of' operator, applies to datalists and stack-allocated arrays (resolves at compile time)
[ ] Don't halt on errors (May not be possible with parser errors)
[ ] Move all DAT emission to top of program so locations can be predicted and folded
[ ] Implement http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sethi%E2%80%93Ullman_algorithm
[ ] BUG: Variables leak out of IF/WHILE blocks when condition is constant UPDATE: Apparently I neglected to implement branch block scopes at all.
[ ] Preprocessor (Perhaps the constant folding pass can expand defines?)
[ ] Default type should (probably) be signed [Though many operations result in unsigned types.]
[ ] Don't emit warnings for folded constant conversions that don't lose data.
[ ] Freestore/heap implementation
[ ] pre/post inc/dec operators
[ ] improved error reporting
[ ] Unary -
