A high level overview of DCPUC

program = *(statement)
statement = variable declaration | function declaration | if | assignment | function call | block
variable declaration = var identifier
function declaration = function identifier(comma-separated parameter list) { statements }
if = if (expression) statement
assignment = expression = expression
function call = identifier(parameters)
block = { statements }

Like C, all statements are terminated with ';'.
Execution begins at the first statement in the file (skipping function declarations).
Variables have no type and are declared with a 'var' statement.
Variables must be initialized (Note: Not implemented. As of writing this, variables can not be initialized when declared.)
In conditionals, 0 = false, anything else = true. So far, only == and != are supported.
All functions return a value. If a function does not have a return statement, then whatever is left at the top of the stack when it returns will be assumed to be the return value. This might corrupt the stack.
The unary * operator 'dereferences' whatever it is applied to. It will return the value at the value of it's operand. It is the same as the [] syntax in the DCPU-16 spec, or a pointer in C. It can also be assigned to. For example, var video = 0x8000; *video = 72; will write the character 'H' to address 0x8000, the first word of video memory.
